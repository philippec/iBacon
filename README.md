iBacon 
======

Source for the iBacon passbook pass created for SecondConf 2013.

To use, you will need to change at least the passTypeIdentifier,
webServiceURL and teamIdentifier. If you do not, you will not be able to
sign the pass for deployment.

You will probably want to change the serialNumber an
authenticationToken, too.

Instructions for creating a signing certificate and creating the .pkpass
from the .raw folder can be found at http://developer.apple.com/passbook
